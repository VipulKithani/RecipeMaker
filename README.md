# RecipeMaker
It is a web project based on html , css , php , javascript . In which a user will select ingredients and a Recipe is generated
Well The need of the project is that if there are few ingredients in our fridge and we dont know what and which kind of recipe can be made using these kind of ingredients.
Than just select the ingredients in our web page and submit it a recipe of that ingredients will be generated.
This is not a full fledge ebpage it is just a demo, But u can add items of your choice and make it advance.
Thank you
